# Sykes interview project

I chose to use Laravel for this project to prove that I can adapt to the tech stack used in your work
and to use this task as a learning opportunity.

The DB has been set up using the provided SQL, under MySQL as that is what I'm used to. The spec didn't say whether to use/create
 ORM models or to use SQL directly, I decided to use SQL as to show what I am used to (e.g. PropertyRepository). In a real-world
project I would use an ORM as it would provide safeguards against bad SQL.

To make designing the UI quicker I decided to utilize TailwindCSS, which integrated nicely with blade. For testing, I'm using PHPUnit
as it's what I use in my current position.

When reviewing this submission, please take into account that I didn't have a lot of time to finish everything :)
